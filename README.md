This project performs **sentiment classification** on text data using machine learning and NLP techniques.  
The dataset used in this project is **self-created**, which includes manually collected and labelled text samples for Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Text cleaning & preprocessing  
- Tokenization & stopword removal  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**  
- Training machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

**Dataset:**  
✔ Self-created  
✔ Custom text samples  
✔ Labeled manually into 3 sentiment classes
